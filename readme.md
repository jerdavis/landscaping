# Backyard patio project
We're looking for quotes on building a patio off our garage in South Minneapolis. Here's the existing space.

## Retaining wall
The retaining wall will need to be extended around 13' to the south and sloped back to the garage wall. The height of the existing retaining wall is around 17 1/2" from the soil level. It's a 3 course wall of 16" x 12" x 6" blocks.

## Patio 
The patio surface would measure around 20' x 12'. We'd demo / remove the existing brick pavers prior to work beginning. Here are some examples of materials we'd be interest in for the patio surface. We want a semi-modern, clean design. We really like slate, but budget is a big factor so we're open to options between manufactured or natural stone.
